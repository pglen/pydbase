\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Fast data save / retrieve}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
The motivation was to create a no frills way of saving / retrieving data fast. the command line tester can drive most aspects of this API;\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{API}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
The module \textquotesingle{}twincore\textquotesingle{} uses two data files and a lock file. The file names are generated from the base name of the data file. .pidx for the index, .lock for the lock file. The lock file times out in 0.\+3 seconds and breaks the lock. (in case of frozen process)

Setting verbosity and debug level\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}twincore.core_quiet = quiet
twincore.core_verbose = verbose
twincore.core_pgdebug = pgdebug
twincore.core_showdel = sdelx

(setting before data creation will display mesages from the construtor)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Example db creation\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}core = twincore.TwinCore(deffile)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Some basic ops\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}dbsize = core.getdbsize()

core.save_data(keyx, datax)
rec_arr = core.retrieve(keyx, ncount)
print("rec_arr", rec_arr)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Structure of the data\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
\begin{DoxyVerb}32 byte header, starting with FILESIG

4 bytes    4 bytes          4 bytes         Variable
------------------------------------------------------------
RECSIG     Hash_of_key      Len_of_key      DATA_for_key
RECSEP     Hash_of_payload  Len_of_payload  DATA_for_payload

    .

    .

RECSIG     Hash_of_key      Len_of_key      DATA_for_key
RECSEP     Hash_of_payload  Len_of_payload  DATA_for_payload

where:
RECSIG="RECB" (record begin here)
RECSEP="RECS" (record separated here)
RECDEL="RECX" (record deleted)

Deleted records are marked with RECSIG mutated from RECB to RECX

  Vacuum will remove the deleted records; Make sure your database has no
pending ops; or non atomic opts;

    (like: find keys - delete keys in two ops)

  New data is appended to the end, no duplicate filtering is done.
Retrieval is searched from reverse, the latest record with this key
is retrieved first. Most of the times this behavior is what people
want; also the record history is kept this way, also a desirable
behavior.

 \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{The test executable script\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
The file \mbox{\hyperlink{pydbase_8py}{pydbase.\+py}} exercises most of the twincore functionality. It also provides examples of how to drive it.

Here is the help screen of pydebase.\+py\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    Usage: pydebase.py [options]
      Options: -h         help (this screen)
               -V         print version        ||  -q   quiet on
               -d         debug level (0-10)   ||  -v   increment verbosity level
               -r         write random data    ||  -w   write record(s)
               -z         dump backwards(s)    ||  -i   show deleted record(s)
               -U         Vacuum DB            ||  -R   re-index / recover DB
               -f  file   input or output file (default: 'pydbase.pydb')

               -a  str    data to save (quotes for multi words)
               -y  key    find by key
               -t  key    retrieve by key
               -o  offs   get data from offset
               -e  offs   delete at offset
               -u  rec    delete at position
    The default action is to dump records to screen in reverse order.

 \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Comparison to other databases\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
This comparison is to show the time it takes to write 500 records. In the tests the record size is about the same (Hello /vs/ \char`\"{}111 222\char`\"{}) Please see the sqlite\+\_\+test.\+sql for details of data output;

The test can be repeated with running the \textquotesingle{}time.\+sh\textquotesingle{} script file. Please note the the time.\+sh clears all files tests/$\ast$ for a fair test. \begin{DoxyVerb}    sqlite time test, writing 500 records ...
    real    0m1.249s
    user    0m0.008s
    sys 0m0.071s
    pydbase time test, writing 500 records ...
    real    0m0.043s
    user    0m0.034s
    sys 0m0.008s
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Please mind the fact that the sqlite engine has to do a lot of parsing which we skip doing; That is why pydbase is more than an order of magnitude faster ...\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Saving more complex data}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
The database saves a key / value pair. However, the key can be mutated to contain meta data. (for example adding a string in front of it.) \mbox{[}like\+: CUST\+\_\+ for customer details\mbox{]} Also the key can be made unique by adding a UUID to it.

The data can consist of any text / binary. The library \mbox{\hyperlink{pypacker_8py}{pypacker.\+py}} can pack any data into a string; A copy of pypacker is included here.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{pypacker.\+py}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
This module can pack arbitrary python data into a string; which can be used to store anything in the pydbase data section.

Example from running \mbox{\hyperlink{testpacker_8py}{testpacker.\+py}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}org: (1, 2, 'aa', ['bb', b'dd'])
packed: pg s4 'iisa' i4 1 i4 2 s2 'aa' a29 'pg s2 'sb' s2 'bb' b4 'ZGQ=' '
unpacked: [1, 2, 'aa', ['bb', b'dd']]
rec_arr: pg s4 'iisa' i4 1 i4 2 s2 'aa' a29 'pg s2 'sb' s2 'bb' b4 'ZGQ=' '
rec_arr_upacked: [1, 2, 'aa', ['bb', b'dd']]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 There is also the option of using pypacker on the key itself. Because the key is identified by its hash, there is no speed penalty; Note that the hash is a 32 bit one; collisions are possible, however unlikely; To compensate, make sure you compare the key proper with the returned key.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Maintenance}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
The DB can rebuild its index and purge all deleted records. In the test utility the options are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    ./pydbase.py -U     for vacuum (add -v for verbosity)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The database is re-\/built, the deleted entries are purged, the damaged data (if any) is saved into a separate file, created with the same base name as the data base, with the \textquotesingle{}.perr\textquotesingle{} extension. \begin{DoxyVerb}  ./pydbase.py -R     for re-index
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The index is recreated; as of the current file contents. This is useful if the index is lost (like copying the data only)

If there is a data file without the index, the re-\/indexing is called automatically. In case of deleted data file, pydbase will recognize the dangling index and nuke it.

Note about the \textquotesingle{}garbage\textquotesingle{} directory ... older stuff I tried; some are really useful; For instance take a look at the simplifier\+: an array of indexes to save offsets and lengths; The simplifier makes one range out of overlapping or close to each other ranges.
