\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Twincore}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
Database with two files. One for data, one for index;

The reason for this name is that two files are created. The first contains the data, the second contains the offsets (indexes) and hashes.

The second file can be re-\/built easily from the first the the reindex option.

Structure of the data\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}32 byte header, starating with FILESIG;

 Deleted records are marked with RECSIG mutated from RECB to RECX

New data is appended to the end, no duplicate filtering is done. Retrieval is searched from reverse, the latest record with this key is retrieved first.
